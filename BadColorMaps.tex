\noindent
We know the rainbow color map is terrible and emphatically reviled by the
visualization community, yet its use continues to persist. Why do we
continue to use a this perceptual encoding with so many known flaws?
Instead of focusing on why we should not use rainbow colors, this position
statement explores the rational for why we do pick these colors despite
their flaws. Often the decision is influenced by a lack of knowledge, but
even experts that know better sometimes choose poorly. A larger issue is
the expedience that we have inadvertently made the rainbow color map
become. Knowing why the rainbow color map is used will help us move away
from it. Education is good, but clearly not sufficient. We gain traction by
making sensible color alternatives the more convenient alternative. It is
not feasible to force a color map on users. Our goal is to supplant the
rainbow color map as a common standard, and we will find that even those
wedded to it will migrate away.

\section{Introduction}

\noindent
A pervasive technique in scientific visualization called pseudocoloring is
to apply colors to an object that vary based on some numerical variable.
Pseudocoloring requires defining a function or map from numerical values to
colors. A color map is typically defined by selecting a continuum of colors
that map linearly to a range of numeric values.
Figure~\ref{fig:ColorMapExample} shows a simple example of a color map
where numeric values between -1 and 0 map to blue colors of varying
brightness and numeric values between 0 and 1 map to red colors.

\begin{figure}[htb]

  \label{fig:ColorMapExample}
\end{figure}

The efficacy of a pseudocolor visualization is contingent on the ability of
a human observer to translate the colors back into the numeric values they
represent. The choice of colors used in a pseudocolor map can have a major
impact on this inverse translation. Consequently, much research has focused
on the perception of color and its impact of the visual display of
data\fix{cite stone, brewer, ware, reigens, rogowitz}. As one might expect,
the color choice can have a dramatic impact on a viewer's performance in
interpreting colors as numbers, and many effective color sets have been
designed for this purpose.

With this rich understanding of color perception, one might think that
modern visualizations make effective use of color. Unfortunately, many
visualizations today use color sets that are known to be extremely
problematic. In particular the rainbow color map, so called for its use of
the spectrum of colors in the rainbow, is pervasively used in visualization
despite the copious evidence that it performs poorly\fix{cite Borland,
  Reigens, Franchesca? Others?}.

This paper is a retrospective on why these bad colors are so commonly
chosen for visualization and is a position statement on what we as
practitioners can do to best promote good color use.

\fix{I am considering having a short section on the evils of the rainbow
  color map if there is room. If I do, I might remove a few lines above. If
  I do not, I might add a statement or two above that we are not addressing
  this because it is so commonly presented.}
