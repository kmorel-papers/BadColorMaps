	Abstract = {Color mapping is an important technique used in visualization to build visual representations of data and information. With output devices such as computer displays providing a large number of colors, developers sometimes tend to build their visualization to be visually appealing, while forgetting the main goal of clear depiction of the underlying data.

Visualization researchers have profited from findings in adjoining areas such as human vision and psychophysics which, combined with their own experience, enabled them to establish guidelines that might help practitioners to select appropriate color scales and adjust the associated color maps, for particular applications.

This survey presents an overview on the subject of color scales by focusing on important guidelines, experimental research work and tools proposed to help non-expert users.

@article{Borkin2011,
	Abstract = {Heart disease is the number one killer in the United States, and finding indicators of the disease at an early stage is critical for treatment and prevention. In this paper we evaluate visualization techniques that enable the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. A key physical quantity of medical interest is endothelial shear stress (ESS). Low ESS has been associated with sites of lesion formation and rapid progression of disease in the coronary arteries. Having effective visualizations of a patient's ESS data is vital for the quick and thorough non-invasive evaluation by a cardiologist. We present a task taxonomy for hemodynamics based on a formative user study with domain experts. Based on the results of this study we developed HemoVis, an interactive visualization application for heart disease diagnosis that uses a novel 2D tree diagram representation of coronary artery trees. We present the results of a formal quantitative user study with domain experts that evaluates the effect of 2D versus 3D artery representations and of color maps on identifying regions of low ESS. We show statistically significant results demonstrating that our 2D visualizations are more accurate and efficient than 3D representations, and that a perceptually appropriate color map leads to fewer diagnostic mistakes than a rainbow color map.
},
	Annote = {This paper does a perceptual study on some parameters of artery visualization using domain experts. One of the most general things tested is the color map. The study pits the rainbow color map against several forms of diverging color maps. Most of the diverging color maps are taken from color brewer with a couple adjusted for domain specific features. (None use that by [Moreland2009]).

The study showed that identifying important regions was both faster and more accurate with a diverging color map than a rainbow color map by a statistically significant margin.

Despite the difference in how well the subjects performed, there was no significant difference in how well the participiants felt they performed. That is, they thought they did as well with the rainbow color maps as with diverging. However, almost all the participants preferred the rainbow color map (meaning it would be their first choice, at least, before the study was concluded).},

@inproceedings{Moreland2009,
	Abstract = {One of the most fundamental features of scientific visualization is the process of mapping scalar values to colors. This process allows us to view scalar fields by coloring surfaces and volumes. Unfortunately, the majority of scientific visualization tools still use a color map that is famous for its ineffectiveness: the rainbow color map. This color map, which naively sweeps through the most saturated colors, is well known for its ability to obscure data, introduce artifacts, and confuse users. Although many alternate color maps have been proposed, none have achieved widespread adoption by the visualization community for scientific visualization. This paper explores the use of diverging color maps (sometimes also called ratio, bipolar, or double-ended color maps) for use in scientific visualization, provides a diverging color map that generally performs well in scientific visualization applications, and presents an algorithm that allows users to easily generate their own customized color maps.},

	Abstract = {Scientists from the Climate, Ocean and Sea Ice Modeling Team (COSIM) at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) are interested in gaining a deeper understanding of three primary ocean currents: the Gulf Stream, the Kuroshio Current, and the Agulhas Current & Retroflection. To address these needs, visual artist Francesca Samsel teamed up with experts from the areas of computer science, climate science, statistics, and perceptual science. By engaging an artist specializing in color, we created colormaps that provide the ability to see greater detail in these high-resolution datasets. The new colormaps applied to the POP dataset enabled scientists to see areas of interest unclear using standard colormaps. Improvements in the perceptual range of color allowed scientists to highlight structures within specific ocean currents. Work with the COSIM team members drove development of nested colormaps which provide further detail to the scientists.},
	Annote = {Proposes some new color maps, mostly diverging and somewhat based on [Moreland2009]. They are applied to ocean data but are also intended for wider use.

The paper provides anecdotal evidence that the new color maps do a better job showing features in ocean data.

There is also a perceptual study that counts how many unique colors participants can identify. It is one metric of the perceptual resolution of the color map, but does not wholy measure the efficacy. (Rainbow actually scored pretty high in this count for obvious reasons.)

@article{Rogowitz1998,
	Abstract = {A rainbow colormap is often supplied as a default in visualization software. In this kind of colormap, red is mapped to the highest data value, blue to the lowest, and the other data values are interpolated along the full extent of the spectrum. But there is more to color than meets the eye. Color is a perceptual as well as physical phenomenon. What is commonly called color-hue-is only one of three parameters. Another is the brightness of the signal-intensity. The third is the admixture of white -saturation. Change any one parameter enough, and the color looks different. (The hue-intensity-saturation model of color is one of a several explored through the years, and captures some of the basic characteristics of basic color perception.) To make matters worse, the parameters' relationship to what is perceived is nonlinear. At the same intensity, for example, yellow appears brighter than blue. Some of the perceptual principles involved have been implemented in software developed at IBM Corp.'s Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY. The module runs with IBM's visualization package Data Explorer and is called Pravda (for perceptual rule based architecture for visualizing data accurately)},

@article{Mullen1985,
	Abstract = {A method of producing red-green and blue-yellow sinusoidal chromatic gratings is used which permits the correction of all chromatic aberrations. A quantitative criterion is adopted to choose the intensity match of the two colours in the stimulus: this is the intensity ratio at which contrast sensitivity for the chromatic grating differs most from the contrast sensitivity for a monochromatic luminance grating. Results show that this intensity match varies with spatial frequency and does not necessarily correspond to a luminance match between the colours. Contrast sensitivities to the chromatic gratings at the criterion intensity match are measured as a function of spatial frequency, using field sizes ranging from 2 to 23 deg. Both blue-yellow and red-green contrast sensitivity functions have similar low-pass characteristics, with no low-frequency attenuation even at low frequencies below 0.1 cycles/deg. These functions indicate that the limiting acuities based on red-green and blue-yellow colour discriminations are similar at 11 or 12 cycles/deg. Comparisons between contrast sensitivity functions for the chromatic and monochromatic gratings are made at the same mean luminances. Results show that, at low spatial frequencies below 0.5 cycles/deg, contrast sensitivity is greater to the chromatic gratings, consisting of two monochromatic gratings added in antiphase, than to either monochromatic grating alone. Above 0.5 cycles/deg, contrast sensitivity is greater to monochromatic than to chromatic gratings.},

@article{Ware1988,
	Abstract = {Pseudocoloring for presenting univariate map information on a graphic display system is investigated. The kinds of information available in maps are divided into two classes: metric information denotes the quantity stored at each point on the surface, and form information denotes the shape or structure of the surface. Theoretical principles are proposed to predict which color sequences will be effective at conveying value and form information respectively. According to this theory, a scale that approximates the physical spectrum should be good at conveying value information, because of the reduced effects of simultaneous contrast. It should be poor at conveying form information, however, because the brain prefers form information to come through the lightness-processing channel. Conversely, a gray scale should be poor at conveying value information and good at conveying form information, according to the same theory. These predictions are tested in a series of psychophysical experiments that test five color sequences. The results show that simultaneous contrast can be a major source of error when reading maps, but only partially confirm the form hypothesis. Guidelines are given for designing color sequences to be effective in both conveying form and value information. An experimental color sequence is presented to illustrate these guidelines.},
